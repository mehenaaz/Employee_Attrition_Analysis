Here we can interpret the reasons why employees had left the company:

•Promotions: Employees are far more likely to quit their job if they haven't received a promotion in the last 5 years.

•Salary: Most of the employees that quit among the mid or low salary groups.

•Time spend: Most of them quit their job around the three-year mark. Another important point is 6-years point, where the employee is very unlikely to leave.

•Projects: The employee with less and more number of projects are likely to leave.

•Satisfaction level: Though the left employees had done more work than the existing employees, their satisfaction is very low
